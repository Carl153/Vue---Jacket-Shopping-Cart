# Vue---Jacket-Shopping-Cart

This piece of work was part of our HTML and JavaScript assignment for Web Development.
It displays a basic webpage with a built-in shopping cart to add and subtract items.
It also contains a small review section where the customer can write and submit a review of the product.

Some screenshots of the page:
